##### Step 1
1. Select the box icon located in the upper left-hand corner of the map. Use this to select your potential study site area.
2. Select either **random** sites or **village** sites. Village sites will find all of the towns and villages in the selected area using OpenStreetMap, and random sites will randomly place points on the map equal to the number of random sites inputted. 
3. If you already have potential sites, please upload a list of the sites in CSV format. The CSV should contain a column labeled *site*, which has the site name, and columns with *latitude* and *longitude* in decimal degrees.
4. Press **go**. The bounding box coordinates of your selected area will be printed, along with the number of potential sites (including your input sites).

##### Step 2
1. Please head to [ESA WorldCover Viewer](https://viewer.esa-worldcover.org/worldcover/) to download a landcover raster for your area. If your area encompasses multiple tiles, please merge and upload. 
2. Input the distance from the center of each potential point you would like the landcover analyzed from.
3. Press **go**. The calculations may take a while to run. A plot of the landcover for your selected area will be printed when finished. 

##### Step 3
1. After completing step 2, press **go** to display a scatterplot of the parameters analyzed. Use the drop down to change the x-axis and y-axis parameters, and the filter bars to change data included.
2. The comparison plot and table shows the values of your input sites relative to the other sites analyzed. 
3. The data tab allows you to export the analyzed data. If you apply any filtering parameters this will also apply to the data table. This table can be uploaded at the beginning of step 3 to skip steps 1 and 2.
