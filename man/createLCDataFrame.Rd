\title{Analyze categorical land cover surrounding a list of sites}
\usage{
createLCDataFrame(in_df, r, dist, progress = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{in_df}{A data frame containing site information, including a `geometry` column with spatial point or polygon data.}

\item{r}{A categorical raster (`SpatRaster`) representing land cover classifications.}

\item{dist}{Numeric. The radius (in map units) around each site to extract land cover information.}

\item{progress}{Logical. If `TRUE`, updates a progress bar during processing.}
}
\value{
A data frame summarizing land cover metrics for each site, including total area, mean patch area, and proportion of land cover types.
}
\description{
This function calculates land cover statistics for each site based on a given radius, using a categorical raster.
}
\details{
The function processes each site by:
1. Cropping the land cover raster within the specified radius.
2. Calculating total cell area for each land cover type.
3. Computing patch metrics such as mean patch area.
4. Aggregating and restructuring the results into a long-format data frame.
